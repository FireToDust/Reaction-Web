for achieving deterministic execution across different hardware platforms, ensuring identical game outcomes for competitive multiplayer.Identical Inputs → Identical Outputs: Essential for fair PvP gameplay and competitive integrity.Cross-Platform Consistency: Same results across different hardware, GPU architectures, and drivers.Replay Capability: Matches must be perfectly reproducible from recorded input sequences.Decision: Simultaneous single-read/single-write GPU passes with deterministic internal rules.How It Works:\nAll tiles read from one texture\nAll tiles write to separate output texture\nProcessing order doesn't matter because no tile reads another tile's writes\nDeterministic internal rules govern tile behavior\nRationale: Achieves determinism without complex spatial ordering or thread synchronization overhead.Alternative Considered: Spatial ordering strategy (process tiles top-left to bottom-right) - rejected for implementation complexity.No Floating-Point Operations: All physics calculations use fixed-point arithmetic (scaled integers).Platform Independence: Avoids floating-point precision differences across GPU architectures and driver implementations.Consistency: Integer operations produce identical results on all hardware.Precision Format: 16.16 fixed-point (16 bits integer, 16 bits fractional).Scale Factor: 2^16 = 65536⚠️ NEEDS SPECIFICATION: Exact precision requirements for velocity and position through gameplay testing.Addition (trivial):fn fixed_point_add(a: vec2&lt;i32&gt;, b: vec2&lt;i32&gt;) -&gt; vec2&lt;i32&gt; { return a + b;\n}\nMultiplication:fn fixed_point_multiply(a: i32, b: i32) -&gt; i32 { return (i64(a) * i64(b)) &gt;&gt; 16;\n}\nDivision:fn fixed_point_divide(numerator: i32, denominator: i32) -&gt; i32 { return (i64(numerator) &lt;&lt; 16) / i64(denominator);\n}\nBit Precision: Balance between accuracy and overflow risk.Rounding Consistency: Deterministic rounding rules applied uniformly across all calculations.Range Limits: Fixed-point format constrains maximum values (prevents overflow in extreme cases).No Shared Mutable State: Tiles don't share mutable state during GPU pass execution.Read/Write Separation: Texture ping-ponging prevents read-after-write hazards.Data Race Prevention: Concurrent read/write conflicts eliminated by architecture.Selective Use: Atomic operations only where absolutely necessary (e.g., marking active chunks).Deterministic Atomics: When used, atomic operations follow consistent ordering rules.Minimal Dependency: Architecture minimizes need for atomics through pass design.Replay Testing: Identical input sequences must produce identical outputs across platforms.Hardware Variation: Test on NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel GPU architectures.Driver Versions: Validate consistency across different graphics driver versions.⚠️ NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION: Automated cross-platform validation test suite.Checksum Verification: Calculate state checksums at frame boundaries.Regression Detection: Automated testing prevents determinism breaks during development.CI/CD Integration: Determinism validation runs on every commit.Minimal Impact: Simultaneous read/write approach adds negligible overhead.Integer Operations: GPU integer math is as fast as (or faster than) floating-point.Memory Usage: Texture ping-ponging doubles memory usage but ensures safety.Maintain Determinism: All optimizations must preserve deterministic behavior.Memory Access Patterns: Optimize texture reads while keeping deterministic guarantees.Early Termination: Can skip processing for provably inactive regions without breaking determinism.Physics implements deterministic execution through:\nFixed-point arithmetic for all force calculations\nSimultaneous read/write passes for collision and movement\nInteger-only velocity and position updates\nSee cross-reference<a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"internal-link\"

regions of the game world.Force Vectors: Each spell shape stores a force vector to be applied to overlapping objects.Trigger Timing: Forces applied when spell triggers (after delay countdown).Overlap Detection: Objects check if their center point overlaps any active spell shapes.Impulse Elements: Apply instantaneous velocity changes (add to current velocity).Velocity-Set Elements: Directly replace

check diffs carefully\nKeep commits focused - avoid mixing unrelated changes\nTest your changes locally before pushing\nBefore committing work, ask:\nCan someone else understand this without asking me questions?\nAm I making any claims I can't back up?\nIs this the simplest solution that solves the actual problem?\nHave I clearly indicated what needs team discussion?\nAre my commit messages clear and descriptive?\nHave I tested my changes locally?\nThe goal is sustainable development where team members can confidently build on each other's work.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Development Principles","level":1,"id":"Development_Principles_0"},{"heading":"Core Values","level":2,"id":"Core_Values_0"},{"heading":"Truth Over Polish","level":3,"id":"Truth_Over_Polish_0"},{"heading":"Clarity Over Cleverness","level":3,"id":"Clarity_Over_Cleverness_0"},{"heading":"Collaboration Over Ego","level":3,"id":"Collaboration_Over_Ego_0"},{"heading":"Purpose Over Process","level":3,"id":"Purpose_Over_Process_0"},{"heading":"Practical Guidelines","level":2,"id":"Practical_Guidelines_0"},{"heading":"When Writing Code","level":3,"id":"When_Writing_Code_0"},{"heading":"When Writing Documentation","level":3,"id":"When_Writing_Documentation_0"},{"heading":"When Making Decisions","level":3,"id":"When_Making_Decisions_0"},{"heading":"When Updating Existing Work","level":3,"id":"When_Updating_Existing_Work_0"},{"heading":"Source Control Practices","level":3,"id":"Source_Control_Practices_0"},{"heading":"Quality Questions","level":2,"id":"Quality_Questions_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"development/development-principles.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1762904780894,"modifiedTime":1762904780894,"sourceSize":3081,"sourcePath":"development/development-principles.md","exportPath":"development/development-principles.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":50,"backlinks":["development/development.html","index.html"],"type":"markdown"},"development/documentation-structure.html":{"title":"documentation-structure","icon":"","description":"Documentation should function as a navigational search tree where each level provides just enough information to guide readers to the right destination.Parent nodes are signposts, not encyclopedias\nOverview documents help readers navigate to specifics\nInclude enough detail to make informed navigation choices\nAvoid comprehensive coverage at high levels\nNo redundant information\nEach piece of information has one authoritative location\nLink to sources rather than copying content\nUpdate links when information moves\nHierarchical information flow\nOverview → Category → Implementation Details\nGeneral concepts → Specific examples\nArchitecture → Component details\nOverview Documents\nList what's covered and where to find it\nProvide context for understanding relationships\nInclude links to detailed documentation\nDon't duplicate content from linked pages\nCategory Documents\nExplain concepts specific to that category\nDirect readers to implementation details\nShow how pieces relate within the category\nLink to related categories when relevant\nDetail Documents\nContain complete implementation information\nReference but don't duplicate architectural context\nLink back to parent concepts when helpful\nFocus on specific, actionable content\nTop-Down Discovery\nStart with high-level goals or concepts\nFollow links to increasingly specific information\nEach level adds detail without repeating previous levels\nCross-ReferencingThe documentation uses two types of links to distinguish hierarchical structure from references:Regular Links - Use standard wiki-link syntax for direct parent-child relationships:[[child-document|Display Name]]\nCross-Reference Links - Use cross-reference syntax for non-hierarchical links:[cross-reference:: [[other-document|Display Name]]]\nWhen to use cross-reference syntax:\nLinking to files that are NOT direct children of the current document\nReferencing related concepts at the same level or in different branches\nLinking to authoritative sources for shared information\nAny link that represents a reference rather than a structural parent-child relationship\nPurpose: The cross-reference syntax allows Obsidian's graph view to filter out reference links, displaying only the hierarchical documentation tree structure. This makes it easier to visualize and maintain the documentation organization.Guidelines:\nUse regular links to show \"this document contains these sub-topics\"\nUse cross-reference links to show \"see this other document for more information\"\nAvoid circular documentation dependencies regardless of link type\nMaintenance\nWhen information changes, update it in one place\nCheck that navigation paths remain clear\nRemove or redirect broken internal links\nEnsure new content fits the existing hierarchy\nDocumentation files use YAML frontmatter to track document status, categorization, and task management. This metadata integrates with Dataview for automated task tracking and status monitoring.Tracks document lifecycle and implementation state:\nstub - Placeholder document that needs content\ndraft - Being actively written, incomplete\nproposed - Complete proposal awaiting team approval\napproved - Approved design ready for implementation\nimplemented - Code exists matching this documentation\noutdated - Document needs updating to match current state\ndeprecated - Obsolete but kept for historical reference\nExample:---\nstatus: proposed\n---\nCategorizes document type for filtering and organization:\nNavigation - Index, overview, or parent pages\nArchitecture - System architecture and design\nImplementation - Detailed implementation specifications\nReference - API references, data formats, constants\nDevelopment - Development process and workflow\nTesting - Testing strategies and requirements\nPerformance - Performance analysis and optimization\nSecurity - Security considerations and requirements\nMultiplayer - Multiplayer-specific systems\nLegacy - Version 1 reference material\nTaskList - Special: automated task aggregator pages\nExample:---\ntags: - Architecture - Performance\n---\nTask tracking with subcategories using tagged items. Each todo item can have an optional [category] tag at the start:Categories:\n[implementation] - Code needs to be written\n[testing] - Tests need to be written\n[discussion] - Requires team discussion/decision\n[research] - Requires investigation or research\n[documentation] - Documentation needs to be written\n[review] - Needs code or design review\n(no tag) - General uncategorized task\nExample:---\ntodo: - \"[implementation] Detailed performance benchmarking of time slice overhead\" - \"[testing] Cross-platform determinism validation suite\" - \"[discussion] Optimal slice count (current proposal: 8 slices)\" - \"[research] Alternative scheduling algorithms\" - \"[documentation] Complete API reference section\" - \"General task without category\"\n---\nTracks concerns, proposals, and issues requiring attention. Each warning can have an optional [type] tag:Types:\n[proposed] - Proposed system or architectural decision\n[outdated] - Content is outdated and needs updating\n[breaking] - Breaking change to existing implementations\n[performance] - Performance concern or bottleneck\n[security] - Security concern or vulnerability\n[debt] - Technical debt that should be addressed\n(no tag) - General warning\nExample:---\nwarnings: - \"[proposed] Time slice scheduling system enables variable timing\" - \"[performance] High memory usage with 300 snapshot buffer\" - \"[breaking] API changes required for state management\" - \"[debt] Inefficient memory allocation in snapshot system\"\n---\n---\nstatus: proposed\ntags: - Architecture - Multiplayer\ntodo: - \"[implementation] Performance benchmarking of snapshot creation\" - \"[testing] Network bandwidth testing with delta compression\" - \"[discussion] Snapshot retention policy (current: 5 seconds)\"\nwarnings: - \"[proposed] Unified state management serves single and multiplayer\" - \"[performance] Snapshot creation overhead needs measurement\"\n---\nThe subcategorized todo and warning items allow Dataview queries to filter by specific types.

target=\"_self\">Task List</a> for automated queries that collect and organize these items across all documentation.\nUse status to track document maturity through its lifecycle\nApply tags for broad categorization (multiple tags allowed)\nSubcategorize todo items to help with task filtering and prioritization\nSubcategorize warnings to identify types of concerns at a glance\nUpdate status as documents progress from draft → proposed → approved → implemented\nMark documents as outdated when code diverges from documentation\nThe goal is that readers can efficiently find exactly what they
