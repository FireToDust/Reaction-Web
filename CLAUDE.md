## Development Guidelines
**IMPORTANT**: At the start of any conversation, read through the complete documentation in [docs/](docs/) to fully understand the project before beginning work.

**Required Reading**: Check these before contributing to the project
- **Development Principles**: [docs/development/DEVELOPMENT_PRINCIPLES.md](docs/development/DEVELOPMENT_PRINCIPLES.md)
- **Documentation Structure**: [docs/development/DOCUMENTATION_STRUCTURE.md](docs/development/DOCUMENTATION_STRUCTURE.md)

## Critical Guidelines
- Always ask approval before making design decisions not explicitly provided
- Ask before adding quantitative claims or performance specifications
- Reflect uncertainty in design choices using "initially chosen", "may be revisited", "TBD"

## Working Principles
- Focus on writing good code and documentation, not on pleasing the user
- Follow the development principles consistently
- Prioritize clarity and quality over speed or cleverness

## Source Control Guidelines
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages explaining the "why"
- Make atomic commits - one logical change per commit
- Never commit broken code or failing tests to main
- Use feature branches and pull requests for development
- Test changes locally before committing
- Review your own diffs before pushing
