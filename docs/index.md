# Welcome to Reaction V2

## A Real-Time PvP Grid-Based Spellcasting Game

Reaction v2 is a complete reimagining of the original Reaction game, featuring GPU-accelerated physics, deterministic gameplay, and a powerful spell crafting system where players cast spells that place magical runes, transforming terrain through physics-based rule systems.

## Current Status: Architecture Phase

We're currently in the architecture design phase, focusing on creating robust system designs before moving to implementation.

## Key Features

- **Real-time PvP Combat** - Fast-paced multiplayer battles on grid-based terrain
- **Spell Crafting System** - Create custom spell combinations using magical runes
- **Rule-based Physics** - Dynamic terrain transformation through deterministic physics
- **GPU Acceleration** - High-performance rendering and physics calculations
- **Deterministic Gameplay** - Consistent game state across all clients for competitive play
