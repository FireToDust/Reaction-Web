# Performance Strategy

Optimization approaches and technical constraints for tile processing performance.

## Performance Requirements

⚠️ **NEEDS DISCUSSION**: Specific performance targets and constraints have not been established yet.

**General Goals**:
- Support many active tiles simultaneously
- Performance should scale with activity level rather than world size

## Optimization Systems

### Active Region System
**Purpose**: Avoid processing static regions to maintain performance.

**Implementation**:
- Divide world into 32×32 tile chunks (chosen to balance GPU workgroup efficiency with memory overhead)
- Track chunks with active tiles in GPU buffer
- Shaders only process listed active chunks
- Activity propagates to neighboring chunks automatically
- Dormant regions have minimal GPU cost

**Benefits**:
- Automatic scaling with activity level
- Efficient memory bandwidth usage
- Reduced compute shader dispatches

### Texture-Based Storage
**GPU Cache Optimization**: Leverage 2D data access patterns for efficient memory reads

**Bit-Packing**: 32-bit tiles maximize cache line utilization
- **Tile Type** (~6 bits): 64 possible types per layer
- **Velocity** (16 bits): Movement vector for physics
- **Custom Data** (10 bits): Health, timers, charges, etc.

**Ping-Ponging**: Dual texture approach prevents read-after-write hazards

### Chunk-Based Processing
**GPU Workgroup Efficiency**: 32×32 chunks align with GPU architecture

**Memory Layout**: Textures use `r32uint` format for optimal GPU cache performance

**Parallel Processing**: Each GPU thread handles one tile for maximum parallelization

⚠️ **POTENTIAL OPTIMIZATIONS**: Additional GPU techniques
- **Memory Coalescing**: Threads in a warp access consecutive memory addresses simultaneously for maximum bandwidth

### Shader Design Principles
⚠️ **GUIDELINE**: Minimize divergent branching
- Structure algorithms so threads in the same warp follow similar execution paths
- When early exits are necessary, group similar work patterns together to reduce warp divergence

## Technical Constraints

### Hard Limits
**Tile Types**: ~64 per layer (chosen to be comfortably under realistic limits)
**World Size**: Fixed at initialization (no dynamic streaming)  
**Mana Types**: 8 maximum (player state buffer constraint)
**Spell Hand**: Size TBD based on UI and gameplay needs

### Performance Scaling
⚠️ **NEEDS DISCUSSION**: Specific performance characteristics to be determined through testing
- 32×32 chunks chosen to balance GPU workgroup efficiency with memory overhead
- GPU texture cache considerations
- Parallel processing efficiency targets

## Offline Optimizations

### Rule Compilation Approach
⚠️ **SUGGESTION**: Potential optimization techniques for rule compilation:
- Compile-time specialization for specific use cases
- Dead code elimination for unused rule paths
- Constant folding for pre-computed values
- Loop unrolling for neighbor checks

### Build-Time Processing
**Shader Generation**: Move complex rule logic to build time
**Asset Optimization**: Texture and mesh preprocessing
**⚠️ NEEDS DESIGN**: Specific optimization pipeline implementation

## Risk Management

### Performance Monitoring
⚠️ **SUGGESTION**: Potential monitoring and validation approaches:
- Automated benchmarks to prevent regressions
- Frame timing and bottleneck profiling
- Determinism validation across runs

### Bottleneck Identification
⚠️ **Major Unsolved Issues**:
- Frame rate coordination between different systems
- GPU thread execution order determinism
- Memory bandwidth optimization across modules

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Performance Profiling
⚠️ **SUGGESTION**: Potential profiling capabilities to develop:
- Frame timing monitoring for pipeline stages
- GPU utilization tracking
- Memory bandwidth analysis
- Active region processing visualization

### Debug Capabilities
⚠️ **SUGGESTION**: Potential debugging tools:
- Tile inspector for real-time data examination
- Rule tracer for activation analysis
- Determinism validation tools
