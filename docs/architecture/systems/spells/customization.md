# Customization Systems

Deck building and curse mechanics for player customization and risk/reward gameplay.

## Deck Building System

### Collection and Selection
- **Spell Collection**: Players build from available spell library
- **Pre-game Construction**: Deck built before match starts
- **Strategic Focus**: Deck size limits encourage focused strategies
- **Synergistic Design**: Spells designed to work together thematically

### Deck Constraints
⚠️ **NEEDS SPECIFICATION**: Specific deck building rules
- **Deck Size**: Minimum and maximum spell counts TBD
- **Duplicate Limits**: How many copies of same spell allowed?
- **Rarity System**: Different spell availability or costs?
- **Mana Balance**: Requirements for mana type distribution?

### Spell Acquisition
⚠️ **NEEDS DESIGN**: How players acquire new spells for their collection
- **Progression System**: Unlock spells through gameplay?
- **Default Collection**: Starting spells available to all players?
- **Expansion Content**: New spells added over time?

## Curse System

### Design Philosophy
**Power vs. Risk**: Cursed builds offer advantages with meaningful drawbacks
**Build Balance**: ⚠️ **NEEDS DISCUSSION** - Balance approach between pure and cursed builds
**Diversity**: ⚠️ **SUGGESTION** - Support multiple build approaches

### Example Curses
⚠️ **SUGGESTION**: Potential curse concepts for future design:

**Glass Cannon**: +50% spell damage, -50% health
**Mana Leak**: -1 mana cost for spells, 20% spell failure rate  
**Berserker**: +2 spell range when below 25% health, -1 max health

⚠️ **NEEDS BALANCING**: Specific numbers and effects require playtesting

### Curse Mechanics
⚠️ **NEEDS SPECIFICATION**: Implementation details for curse system
- **Curse Selection**: How many curses can player choose?
- **Stacking Rules**: Can multiple curses be combined?
- **Activation Conditions**: When do curse effects trigger?
- **Balancing**: How to ensure curses remain balanced risk/reward choices?

## Strategic Considerations

### Build Archetypes
⚠️ **SUGGESTION**: Potential build approaches to consider:
- Direct damage focus
- Area control emphasis
- Spell combination reliance
- Defensive/survival priority

### Meta Considerations
⚠️ **ONGOING BALANCE CHALLENGE**:
- Preventing dominant strategies from overshadowing others
- Encouraging experimentation with different build types
- Maintaining viability of both cursed and pure builds
- Adapting to emerging player strategies

## Player Expression

### Customization Depth
**Meaningful Choices**: Each deck building decision impacts gameplay significantly
**Personal Style**: Support for different tactical preferences and risk tolerances
**Skill Expression**: Reward players who master complex spell combinations

### Accessibility vs. Depth
**Learning Curve**: New players need viable simple strategies
**Mastery Ceiling**: Expert players should have room for optimization and innovation
**Clear Feedback**: Players should understand why their builds succeed or fail

## Integration with Game Systems

### Mana System Integration
**Flower Allocation**: Deck composition influences optimal mana flower distribution
**Recharge Timing**: Curse effects may interact with mana recharge cycles
**Resource Planning**: Spell costs drive strategic resource management

### Gameplay Balance
**Match Duration**: Deck composition affects typical game length
**Power Scaling**: Prevent early-game dominance or late-game stalls
**Interactive Gameplay**: Encourage player-vs-player interaction over solitaire optimization

## Implementation Considerations

### Data Storage
⚠️ **NEEDS SPECIFICATION**: How deck and curse data is stored and validated
- **Deck Validation**: Ensure legal deck construction
- **Curse Verification**: Prevent invalid curse combinations
- **Persistence**: Save player collections and preferred builds

### User Interface
⚠️ **NEEDS DESIGN**: Deck building and curse selection interfaces
- **Deck Builder**: Intuitive spell selection and organization
- **Curse Interface**: Clear presentation of risk/reward trade-offs
- **Preview System**: Show how builds affect gameplay before committing

### Balance Maintenance
⚠️ **ONGOING REQUIREMENT**: Systems for monitoring and adjusting balance
- **Data Collection**: Track win rates and usage patterns
- **Adjustment Mechanisms**: How to modify spell or curse balance
- **Community Feedback**: Integration of player feedback into balance decisions
