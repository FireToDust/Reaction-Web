# CPU Architecture

Processing model and integration approach for the spell system's CPU-based design.

## Design Rationale

### CPU-Only Processing Choice
**Initial Decision**: Initially chosen for CPU because it handles direct player input and seemed more straightforward to implement. This choice may be revisited during implementation.

**Current Advantages**:
- Complex conditional logic: Spell rules without GPU shader limitations
- Easy debugging: Step-through debugging and rule modification
- Immediate response: Direct response to player input without GPU compilation delays
- Runtime flexibility: Dynamic spell behavior changes possible

### Alternative Considerations
⚠️ **POTENTIAL FUTURE CHANGE**: Moving some spell processing to GPU if CPU becomes performance bottleneck
- **Simple Operations**: Rune countdown timers could be GPU-accelerated
- **Complex Logic**: Combination rules and validation likely remain CPU-bound
- **Hybrid Approach**: CPU for logic, GPU for simple state updates

## Processing Architecture

### Frame Integration
**Input Phase**: Process player spell casts and UI interactions during input processing phase
**Rune Phase**: Handle rune countdown and triggering during dedicated rune processing phase
**Coordination**: Seamless integration with GPU-based physics and reaction systems

### Concurrent Processing
⚠️ **NEEDS SPECIFICATION**: Approach to concurrent spell processing
- **Multi-threading**: Can spell logic be parallelized safely?
- **State Isolation**: Ensure thread safety for simultaneous spell processing
- **Performance Scaling**: CPU utilization across multiple player actions

## Integration with GPU Systems

### Core Engine Integration
**Rune Placement**: Direct texture writes to rune layer
- **Texture Access**: CPU writes directly to GPU texture memory
- **Synchronization**: Coordinate with GPU texture ping-ponging system
- **Error Handling**: Manage GPU resource allocation failures

**State Queries**: Read tile data for spell validation
- **Cache Strategy**: Minimize CPU-GPU memory transfers
- **Data Freshness**: Ensure CPU reads current game state
- **Performance Impact**: Balance query frequency vs. accuracy

### Physics Engine Coordination
**Force Application**: Queue forces for physics engine processing
- **Force Buffer**: Accumulate forces from multiple spell sources
- **Timing Coordination**: Ensure forces apply at correct physics update
- **Vector Math**: Proper force calculation and combination

### Data Flow Management
**Read Operations**: CPU reads game state for spell validation
**Write Operations**: CPU writes rune data and force applications
**Synchronization**: Coordinate with GPU pipeline phases

## Performance Characteristics

### CPU Load Considerations
**Spell Complexity**: Complex spells may create CPU bottlenecks
**Player Scaling**: Performance impact of multiple simultaneous players
**Rune Management**: Cost of tracking many active runes across players

### Optimization Opportunities
⚠️ **SUGGESTIONS** for potential CPU optimizations:
- Caching: Cache frequently-accessed tile data
- Batching: Group multiple spell operations for efficiency  
- Lazy evaluation: Delay expensive calculations until needed
- State compression: Efficient rune data representations

## Memory Management

### CPU-GPU Memory Coordination
⚠️ **NEEDS SPECIFICATION**: Efficient data transfer patterns
- **Transfer Minimization**: Reduce CPU-GPU memory bandwidth usage
- **Buffer Management**: Proper GPU buffer allocation and lifecycle
- **Memory Mapping**: Efficient access to GPU texture data from CPU

### Rune Data Storage
**Active Rune Tracking**: CPU data structures for rune management
**Lifecycle Management**: Efficient creation and cleanup of rune objects
**Memory Pooling**: Reuse memory allocations for performance

## Error Handling and Validation

### Spell Validation
**Mana Verification**: Ensure sufficient mana flowers available
**Range Checking**: Validate spell targets within allowed range
**Obstruction Testing**: ⚠️ **NEEDS DESIGN** - Line of sight or targeting rules
**Cooldown Enforcement**: Prevent casting during mana recharge

### Runtime Error Recovery
**GPU Communication Failures**: Handle GPU resource unavailability
**Invalid State Recovery**: Respond to corrupted game state
**Player Disconnection**: Manage spells from disconnected players
**Performance Degradation**: Respond to CPU performance bottlenecks

## Development and Debugging

### Debugging Capabilities
**Step-through Debugging**: Full debugging support for spell logic
**State Inspection**: Real-time examination of spell and rune state
**Performance Profiling**: CPU usage monitoring and bottleneck identification
**Logic Tracing**: Track spell execution and rule application

### Development Benefits
- Rapid iteration: Quick testing of new spell mechanics
- Rule modification: Runtime changes to spell behavior possible
- Complex logic: Support for complex spell interactions
- Integration testing: Easy testing of CPU-GPU coordination

## Future Architectural Considerations

### Hybrid Processing Potential
⚠️ **POTENTIAL EVOLUTION**: Areas where GPU processing might be beneficial
