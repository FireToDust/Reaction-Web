# GPU Manager System

Shared WebGPU resource management and coordination for all GPU-accelerated systems.

## System Overview

The GPU Manager System manages the WebGPU instance, device initialization, and resource sharing across all systems that require GPU computation or rendering.

**Key Challenge**: Coordinate GPU resource usage across multiple systems (Physics, Reactions, Renderer) while maintaining performance and preventing resource conflicts.

## Core Responsibilities

- **WebGPU device initialization** and capability detection
- **GPU resource allocation** and memory management
- **Compute pipeline coordination** between systems
- **Error handling and recovery** for GPU operations
- **Performance monitoring** and resource utilization tracking

## Resource Management

### Shared Resources
- **WebGPU Device**: Single device instance shared across all systems
- **Buffer Pools**: Reusable buffer allocation for different data types
- **Texture Management**: Coordinate texture creation and lifecycle
- **Compute Queue**: Prioritized command queue for GPU operations

### System Integration
- **Physics System**: Provides compute shaders for collision and movement
- **Reactions System**: Manages rule compilation and execution shaders  
- **Renderer**: Coordinates rendering pipeline and display
- **Core System**: Integrates with texture ping-ponging and memory management

## Technical Features

### Device Management
- **Automatic Fallback**: Handle WebGPU unavailability gracefully
- **Capability Detection**: Query and adapt to GPU limitations
- **Error Recovery**: Robust handling of GPU context loss
- **Performance Profiling**: Built-in GPU timing and resource monitoring

### Resource Coordination  
- **Allocation Tracking**: Monitor buffer and texture usage across systems
- **Memory Optimization**: Efficient sharing and reuse of GPU resources
- **Priority Management**: Coordinate competing GPU workloads
- **Synchronization**: Ensure proper ordering of GPU operations

## Integration Points

### Initialization Interface
- **Device Setup**: Initialize WebGPU device with required features
- **System Registration**: Allow systems to register their GPU requirements
- **Resource Allocation**: Provide standardized buffer/texture allocation

### Runtime Interface
- **Command Submission**: Centralized GPU command queue management
- **Resource Sharing**: Safe sharing of buffers and textures between systems
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time GPU utilization reporting

## Dependencies
- **WebGPU API**: Required for all GPU operations
- **Browser/Platform**: WebGPU support and capabilities
