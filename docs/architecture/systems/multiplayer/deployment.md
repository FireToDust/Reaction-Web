# Deployment Architecture

Container orchestration, regional deployment, and horizontal scaling infrastructure for multiplayer servers.

## Infrastructure Overview

### Container Strategy
**Docker Configuration**:
- NVIDIA Docker runtime for GPU support
- Ubuntu base image with WebGPU drivers
- Node.js runtime with GPU-accelerated libraries
- Minimal attack surface with only required packages

**Container Specifications**:
```dockerfile
FROM nvidia/ubuntu:22.04
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    nodejs npm \
    nvidia-driver-525 \
    vulkan-utils
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY dist/ ./dist/
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["node", "dist/server.js"]
```

**Resource Requirements**:
- 4 vCPU cores per game server instance
- 16GB RAM per server (supports 8-12 concurrent games)

**Alternative: Docker Swarm**:
- Simpler orchestration for smaller deployments
- Built-in load balancing and service discovery
- GPU resource constraints and placement
- Rolling updates with zero-downtime deployment

## Regional Architecture

- Europe (Frankfurt, London)
- Asia-Pacific (Singapore, Tokyo)
- Optional: South America, Australia

**Region Selection Criteria**:
- Player population density
- Network infrastructure quality
- Data sovereignty requirements
- Cost optimization opportunities

### Cross-Region Coordination
**Matchmaking Service**:
- Global player queue management
- Region assignment based on latency
- Cross-region backup for peak times
- Load balancing across regional clusters

**Data Synchronization**:

- Match history and replay data
- Configuration and rule updates
- Security blacklists and ban information

## Scaling Strategy

### Horizontal Scaling
**Auto-Scaling Configuration**:
```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: game-server-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: game-server
  minReplicas: 3
  maxReplicas: 50
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 70
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: nvidia.com/gpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 80
```

**Scaling Triggers**:
- CPU utilization >70%
- GPU utilization >80%
- Memory usage >85%
- Queue length >100 waiting players
- Average response time >100ms

### Vertical Scaling
**Resource Optimization**:
- GPU memory pooling across game instances
- CPU allocation based on actual usage patterns
- Memory tuning for garbage collection optimization
- Network bandwidth allocation per game

**Performance Monitoring**:
- Real-time resource utilization tracking
- Application performance monitoring (APM)
- Custom metrics for game-specific performance
- Alerting for performance degradation

## Service Architecture

### Microservices Design
**Core Services**:
```typescript
interface ServiceArchitecture {
  gameServer: GameServerService;      // Game simulation and state
  matchmaker: MatchmakingService;     // Player matching and queuing  
  authentication: AuthService;       // Player authentication
  statistics: StatsService;          // Match history and analytics
  configuration: ConfigService;      // Game rules and settings
}
```

**Service Communication**:
- gRPC for internal service communication
- Redis for shared state and caching
- Message queues for asynchronous processing
- Service mesh for secure inter-service communication

### Load Balancing
**Application Load Balancer**:
- Session affinity for WebSocket connections
- Health check integration with Kubernetes
- Geographic routing for optimal latency
- SSL termination and certificate management

**Game Server Load Balancing**:
- Consistent hashing for player assignment
- Capacity-based routing
- Failover to backup servers
- Graceful shutdown with player migration

## Database Architecture

### Data Storage Strategy
**Game State**: Redis cluster for real-time state
**Player Data**: PostgreSQL for persistent player information
**Analytics**: ClickHouse for match statistics and telemetry
**Configuration**: etcd for distributed configuration management

### Data Persistence
**Match Replays**:
- Compressed binary format for efficiency
- Object storage (S3/GCS) for long-term archival
- CDN distribution for replay downloads
- Retention policy with automatic cleanup

**Player Profiles**:
- Distributed across regions for performance
- Eventual consistency for non-critical data
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures
- GDPR compliance for data deletion

## Deployment Pipeline

### CI/CD Strategy
**Build Pipeline**:
1. Source code compilation and TypeScript checking
2. Unit and integration test execution
3. Docker image building with security scanning
4. Image tagging and registry push
5. Deployment manifest generation

**Deployment Strategy**:
- Blue-green deployment for zero-downtime updates
- Canary releases for gradual rollout
- Feature flags for controlled feature releases
- Automated rollback on deployment failures

### Environment Management
**Development Environment**:
- Single-region deployment with minimal resources
- Mock services for external dependencies
- Debug logging and development tools
- Rapid iteration and testing capabilities

**Staging Environment**:
- Production-like configuration with reduced scale
- Full integration testing
- Performance and load testing
- Security vulnerability scanning

**Production Environment**:
- Multi-region deployment with full redundancy
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Security hardening and compliance
- Disaster recovery procedures

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Infrastructure Monitoring

- Resource exhaustion warnings
- Security incident detection

**Performance Alerts**:
- Latency degradation (>100ms p95)
- GPU utilization spikes (>90%)
- Memory pressure warnings
- Network congestion detection

### Log Management
**Centralized Logging**:

- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Log aggregation from all services
- Long-term log retention for compliance

**Security Logging**:
- Authentication and authorization events
- Suspicious activity detection
- Security incident correlation
- Audit trail for compliance requirements

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy
**Data Backup**:
- Automated database backups with point-in-time recovery
- Game state snapshots for active matches
- Configuration backup and version control
- Cross-region replication for critical data

**Recovery Procedures**:
- Recovery Time Objective (RTO): 15 minutes
- Recovery Point Objective (RPO): 5 minutes
- Automated failover for database services
- Manual intervention procedures for complex failures

### Business Continuity
**Service Redundancy**:
- Multi-region deployment with active-active configuration
- Automatic traffic rerouting during outages
- Graceful degradation during partial failures
- Communication plan for extended outages

This deployment architecture provides scalable, reliable multiplayer infrastructure capable of supporting global competitive gameplay with minimal latency and maximum uptime.
