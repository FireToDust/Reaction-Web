# Server Architecture

Authoritative game server design with GPU-accelerated simulation identical to client engine.

## Core Components

### GameServer Class
**Purpose**: Central coordinator for multiplayer matches.

**Responsibilities**:
- WebSocket connection management per match
- Player authentication and session management
- Frame timing coordination at 60 FPS
- Match lifecycle (creation, joining, termination)

**Dependencies**: NetworkManager, ServerGameEngine

### ServerGameEngine
**Purpose**: Authoritative game simulation without rendering.

**Responsibilities**:
- Identical deterministic simulation to client engine
- GPU compute shader execution for physics and reactions
- Tile storage and active region management
- State validation and integrity checking

**Key Differences from Client**:
- No rendering pipeline (headless)
- Additional input validation layers
- State snapshot creation for rollback
- Network delta generation

### NetworkManager
**Purpose**: Real-time communication with game clients.

**Responsibilities**:
- WebSocket server lifecycle management
- Input message validation and deserialization
- State update broadcasting with compression
- Connection quality monitoring and adaptation

## Data Flow Architecture

### Input Processing Pipeline
1. **Client Input Reception**: WebSocket message containing player actions
2. **Input Validation**: Verify action legality (mana costs, targeting, timing)
3. **State Application**: Apply validated inputs to authoritative game state
4. **Simulation Step**: Execute physics, reactions, and rule processing
5. **Delta Generation**: Create compressed state updates for clients

### Frame Execution Timing
**60 FPS Target**: 16.67ms frame budget
- Input processing: 2ms
- Simulation execution: 12ms
- Network transmission: 2ms
- Buffer time: 0.67ms

### State Synchronization Strategy
**Full State Snapshots**: Every 60 frames (1 second) as fallback recovery
**Delta Updates**: Every frame with active region optimization
**Priority System**: Critical updates (player health) sent immediately
**Acknowledgment Tracking**: Ensure reliable delivery with retransmission

## GPU Integration

### Headless WebGPU Setup
**Server Environment**: Node.js with WebGPU adapter
**GPU Requirements**: NVIDIA T4 or equivalent with compute capability
**Memory Management**: Shared texture pools across game instances

### Compute Shader Execution
**Identical Logic**: Same shaders as client for deterministic results
**Texture Management**: Ping-pong system adapted for server environment
**Active Region Processing**: Leverage existing chunk optimization

### Performance Scaling
**Instance Batching**: Multiple games on single GPU context
**Memory Pooling**: Reuse GPU resources between matches
**Adaptive Quality**: Reduce simulation fidelity under high load

## Match Management

### Matchmaking Integration
**Room Creation**: Dynamic game instance spawning
**Player Assignment**: Region-based server selection
**Capacity Management**: Load balancing across server instances

### Game Instance Lifecycle
1. **Initialization**: GPU resource allocation and world setup
2. **Player Joining**: Connection establishment and state synchronization
3. **Active Gameplay**: 60 FPS simulation with network updates
4. **Match Conclusion**: Resource cleanup and statistics recording

### Error Handling
**GPU Failures**: Automatic instance migration to backup servers
**Network Issues**: Client reconnection with state recovery
**Crash Recovery**: Persistent state snapshots for match restoration

## Performance Monitoring

### Server Metrics
- Frame timing consistency (target: <16.67ms)
- GPU utilization per instance
- Memory bandwidth consumption
- Network throughput per match

### Bottleneck Detection
**CPU Bound**: Input processing and network I/O optimization
**GPU Bound**: Shader optimization and batch processing
**Memory Bound**: Texture management and garbage collection
**Network Bound**: Compression and prioritization improvements

### Scaling Indicators
- Player queue length
- Average frame processing time
- GPU memory utilization
- Network bandwidth per server

This architecture provides the authoritative foundation for competitive multiplayer while leveraging Reaction's existing deterministic engine design.
