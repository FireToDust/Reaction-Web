# Multiplayer System

Real-time PvP multiplayer architecture using authoritative servers with client-side prediction.

## Overview

The multiplayer system leverages Reaction's deterministic engine design to enable competitive real-time gameplay. An authoritative server runs the identical simulation while clients predict local actions to maintain responsive gameplay.

## Architecture Components

### [Server Architecture](server-architecture.md)
Authoritative game simulation with GPU-accelerated processing identical to client engine.

### [Client Prediction](client-prediction.md) 
Local state prediction with rollback mechanisms for responsive gameplay despite network latency.

### [Network Protocol](network-protocol.md)
WebSocket-based communication with optimized state synchronization and delta compression.

### [Performance Optimization](performance.md)
Bandwidth optimization, server scaling, and latency management strategies.

### [Security & Anti-Cheat](security.md)
Input validation, state integrity, and cheat detection systems.

### [Deployment Architecture](deployment.md)
Container orchestration, regional deployment, and horizontal scaling infrastructure.

## Integration with Core Systems

**Core Engine Integration**
- Server runs headless version of identical simulation
- Leverages existing GPU compute shaders for physics and reactions
- Uses bit-packed tile format for efficient network transmission

**Deterministic Design Benefits**
- Integer-only mathematics ensures identical client/server results
- Strict execution order enables reliable rollback mechanisms
- Active region system scales network bandwidth with activity level

**WebGPU Compatibility**
- Server requires GPU-capable infrastructure
- Compute shaders run identically on both client and server
- Texture ping-ponging system adapted for network synchronization

## Development Priority

1. **Core Networking**: WebSocket protocol and basic state synchronization
2. **Server Engine**: Headless game engine with GPU compute capabilities
3. **Client Prediction**: Local state management with rollback
4. **Performance**: Bandwidth compression and server scaling
5. **Security**: Anti-cheat and input validation systems

## Technical Requirements

**Server Infrastructure**
- GPU-capable servers (NVIDIA T4 or equivalent)
- WebGPU-compatible Node.js environment
- 16GB RAM per game instance (4-8 players)

**Performance Targets**
- 60 FPS authoritative simulation
- <50ms input processing latency
- <16MB bandwidth per player per minute
- Support 100+ concurrent matches per server

This architecture provides competitive multiplayer performance while building on Reaction's existing deterministic engine design.
